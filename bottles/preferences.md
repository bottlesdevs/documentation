# Bottle preferences

This is one of the most important section, here you can configure and tweak your bottle.

![Bottle preferences](<../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png>)

This page is divided into four section:

* Graphics
* System
* Audio
* Developers & Debug

In the **Graphics** section you can set up some graphics related utilities, e.g. you can toggle [DXVK, VKD3D](../components/dxvk.md), Gamemode, the ACO shader compiler or choose to use a virtual desktop with a custom resolution or make Bottles use your discrete GPU (for dual-gpu laptops, like optimus, this will improve performances at the cost of increased power usage).

From the **System** section you can change the runner, the dxvk and vkd3d version, the working directory (the path where the executable will be executed), register new DLL Overrides and choose the synchronization type (wine, esync, fsync).

In the **Audio** section you can toggle the "Reduce PulseAudio latency" feature which improve the audio quality for some games.

The **Developer & Debug** section offers some utilities for developers. Here you can set environment variables, show the wine fixme logs and enable the DXVK HUD to display the FPS counter, draw calls, dxvk versions and other information.
